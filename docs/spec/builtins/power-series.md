# Power Series

## SeriesData
Represents an explicit truncated power series.
- `SeriesData[x, x0, {a0, a1, ..., a_{k-1}}, nmin, nmax, den]`

The `ai` are the coefficients of the series about the expansion point `x0`.
The power of `(x - x0)` attached to `ai` is `(nmin + i)/den`, and a trailing
`O[x - x0]^(nmax/den)` term indicates the order at which higher terms have
been dropped.

**Features**:
- `Protected`.
- `SeriesData` is a pure data head; it has no evaluator and is normally
  produced by `Series`.
- Standard printing renders the series as an ordinary mathematical sum:
  `a0 + a1 (x - x0) + a2 (x - x0)^2 + ... + O[x - x0]^p`. Zero
  coefficients are suppressed, and `x0 == 0` is displayed as simply `x`
  without the subtraction.
- `InputForm[...]` switches to the literal `SeriesData[x, x0, {...},
  nmin, nmax, den]` form, which round-trips through the parser.
- `FullForm[...]` shows the raw tree structure.

```mathematica

```

## Series
Produces the power-series expansion of an expression about a point.
- `Series[f, {x, x0, n}]` — Taylor/Laurent/Puiseux expansion up to order `(x - x0)^n`.
- `Series[f, x -> x0]` — leading-term form. The engine scans the internal expansion for the first non-zero coefficient at exponent `e1` and the next non-zero at `e2 > e1`; the reported `O`-term lands at exponent `e2` (or `e1 + 1` when no further non-zero term exists). So `Series[Sin[x] - x, x -> 0]` returns `-x^3/6 + O[x]^5`, `Series[f[x], x -> 0]` returns `f[0] + O[x]^1`, and analytic-at-x0 inputs collapse to their constant plus `O[x - x0]^1`.
- `Series[f, {x, x0, nx}, {y, y0, ny}, ...]` — iterated multivariate expansion. Each inner coefficient is itself a `SeriesData` in the next variable.
- `Series[f, {x, Infinity, n}]` — expansion at infinity, substituting `x -> 1/u` internally. The emitted `SeriesData` uses `Power[x, -1]` as its variable, so the series prints with `1/x` as the base and an `O[1/x]^(n+1)` term.

**Features**:
- `HoldAll` and `Protected` (so the expansion variable is not evaluated before `Series` has a chance to shield it).
- Threaded over lists: `Series[{f1, f2, ...}, spec]` becomes `{Series[f1, spec], Series[f2, spec], ...}`.
- Handles Taylor expansions for smooth functions, Laurent expansions where the function has a pole at `x0`, Puiseux expansions for fractional-power cases such as `Sqrt[Sin[x]]`, and logarithmic expansions for cases like `x^x` where `Log[x]` survives as a symbolic coefficient.
- Symbolic parameters in exponents are supported: `Series[(1 + x)^n, {x, 0, 4}]` returns the binomial expansion with `n` kept unexpanded.
- Approximate numeric coefficients flow through series arithmetic unchanged.
- For unknown heads (e.g. `f[x]` where `f` has no rules), the engine falls back to naive Taylor via `D` at the expansion point; the coefficients appear as `Derivative[k][f][x0]`.

**Coefficient arithmetic** automatically promotes to BigInt-backed `Rational` when 64-bit numerators or denominators would overflow, so previously-overflowing Laurent/Puiseux cases like `Series[1/Sin[x]^10, {x, 0, 2}]` and `Series[Sqrt[Log[1 + x]], {x, 0, 12}]` now produce exact coefficients (at the cost of slower evaluation for large orders).

Inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic heads (`ArcSin`, `ArcCos`, `ArcTan`, `ArcCot`, `ArcSinh`, `ArcCosh`, `ArcTanh`, `ArcCoth`) are handled by direct series kernels at `u = 0` rather than by naive repeated differentiation, which would blow up expression size exponentially for higher orders. `ArcCosh` uses the principal-branch identity `ArcCosh[u] = I*ArcCos[u]`, so its expansion at `x = 0` has the expected `I*Pi/2` constant term and imaginary coefficients.

Forward reciprocal heads (`Sec`, `Csc`, `Cot`, `Sech`, `Csch`, `Coth`) are rewritten as `1/Cos[x]`, `1/Sin[x]`, `Cos[x]/Sin[x]`, etc., before expansion. Inverse reciprocal heads (`ArcSec`, `ArcCsc`, `ArcSech`, `ArcCsch`) are rewritten via the identities `ArcSec[z] = ArcCos[1/z]`, `ArcCsc[z] = ArcSin[1/z]`, `ArcSech[z] = ArcCosh[1/z]`, `ArcCsch[z] = ArcSinh[1/z]`, so that a blowing-up inner series (e.g. `z = 1/x`) collapses to a convergent kernel case rather than triggering spurious `Power::infy` warnings.

Expansions where the inner series diverges at the expansion point (e.g. `Series[f[1/x], {x, 0, n}]`) are handled via dedicated at-infinity identities:
- `ArcCoth[1/u] = ArcTanh[u]`, `ArcCot[1/u] = ArcTan[u]` (handled at the series level via inner-series inversion).
- `ArcTanh[1/u] = I*Pi/2 + ArcTanh[u]` (principal branch).
- `ArcSinh[1/v] = -Log[v] + Log[1 + Sqrt[1 + v^2]]` and `ArcCosh[1/v] = -Log[v] + Log[1 + Sqrt[1 - v^2]]` (handled by rewriting at the expression level; the symbolic `-Log[x]` term rides the existing `Log[x]` symbolic-coefficient path).

**Asymptotic expansions at Infinity for special functions with essential singularities**: Some functions have no Laurent series at `Infinity` because their leading behaviour is an essential singularity (a factor like `E^x`). For these the generic `x -> 1/u` substitution would hand a pole to naive Taylor, so they are emitted from dedicated asymptotic identities with the essential factor kept symbolic:
- `Series[ExpIntegralEi[x], {x, Infinity, n}]` returns `E^x (1/x + 1/x^2 + 2/x^3 + ... + O[1/x]^(n+1))`, i.e. `Times[Power[E, x], SeriesData[Power[x, -1], 0, {0!, 1!, ..., (n-1)!}, 1, n+1, 1]]` (DLMF 6.12.2: `Ei(x) ~ E^x Σ_{k≥0} k!/x^(k+1)`). The `E^x` factor rides the expression-level `Times` exactly as a symbolic `x^alpha` prefactor does.

**Logarithmic series at `x = 0` for special functions**: Some functions have a finite-radius series at the origin built around a single `Log[x]` branch term, with the log baked into the `x^0` coefficient. Naive Taylor-via-`D` cannot reach these (`f(0)` is infinite or the derivatives have poles), so they are emitted from dedicated identities:
- `Series[ExpIntegralEi[x], {x, 0, n}]` returns `EulerGamma + Log[x] + x + x^2/4 + x^3/18 + ... + O[x]^(n+1)`, i.e. `SeriesData[x, 0, {EulerGamma + Log[x], 1, 1/4, ..., 1/(n*n!)}, 0, n+1, 1]` (DLMF 6.6.2: `Ei(x) = EulerGamma + Log[x] + Σ_{k≥1} x^k/(k k!)`). The `EulerGamma + Log[x]` branch term occupies the `x^0` slot.

**Generalized series in `Log[x]` at `x = 0`**: `LogIntegral[x] = Ei(Log[x])` has *no* ordinary Taylor (or Laurent/Puiseux) series at `x = 0`: as `x -> 0+`, `L = Log[x] -> -Infinity` drives it into Ei's asymptotic regime, so the result is a generalized series whose `x^1` coefficient is itself a series in `1/Log[x]`.
- `Series[LogIntegral[x], {x, 0, n}]` returns `x Σ_{k=0}^{2n+1} k!/Log[x]^(k+1) + O[x]^(n+1)`. For `n = 2` this is `((120 + 24 Log[x] + 6 Log[x]^2 + 2 Log[x]^3 + Log[x]^4 + Log[x]^5) x)/Log[x]^6 + O[x]^3`, matching Mathematica's `Assumptions -> x > 0` output. Since the only `x`-dependence is the prefactor `E^L = x`, every term carries exactly `x^1`; the coefficient slot is emitted as `Together[Σ k!/Log[x]^(k+1)]`. Mathematica's no-assumptions form additionally wraps this in a `Floor[Arg[...]]` branch discriminator (to track `Log[1/x]` vs `Log[x]` across the cut); Mathilda always emits the principal `x > 0` form.

**Internal padding for symbolic expansion points**: The engine computes series at a padded internal order (user order + 12 by default) so that intermediate Laurent/Puiseux operations don't lose accuracy. When the expansion point `x0` is not a literal number, padding is capped at 2 — at a symbolic point the series coefficients are themselves symbolic expressions (e.g. `Cosh[a]`, `Sinh[a]`), and the `O(N^2)` convolution inside `so_inv`/`so_div` would otherwise spin indefinitely on exponentially growing expression trees. This makes cases like `Series[Coth[x], {x, a, 1}]`, `Series[Tanh[x], {x, a, 1}]`, `Series[Sec[x], {x, a, 1}]`, and `Series[1/Cosh[x], {x, a, 1}]` terminate in milliseconds.

**Constant inputs**: If `f` is free of the expansion variable (e.g. `Series[0, {x, 0, 4}]`, `Series[Sin[y], {x, 0, 4}]`, `Series[a + b^2, {x, 0, 3}]`), `Series` returns `f` verbatim instead of wrapping it in a trivial `SeriesData`.

**Symbolic prefactors**: A factor of `x^alpha` with `alpha` symbolic (non-integer, non-rational) is pulled outside the expansion so the remaining body is expanded as an ordinary power series. For example, `Series[x^a Exp[x], {x, 0, 5}]` returns `x^a (1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + x^5/120 + O[x]^6)` — a `Times[Power[x, a], SeriesData[...]]` at the expression level, so the `SeriesData` pretty-printer still renders the body and the outer `Times` decorates it with the symbolic prefactor.

**Expansion at regular points of `Arc*` heads**: When `so_apply_kernel_at_zero` can't apply (because the inner series constant `c` is not `0`), the engine falls back to naive Taylor via `D`. This makes `Series[ArcSin[x], {x, 1/2, 3}]`, `Series[ArcTan[x], {x, 2, 2}]`, `Series[ArcSinh[x], {x, 1, 2}]`, etc. work without special-casing each non-zero expansion point.

**Maxima-style algebraic fast paths**:
- **Monomial binomial** `(a + b x^m)^alpha` with `alpha` non-integer. The generic path factors out `a`, forms `u = (b/a) x^m`, and feeds `(1+u)^alpha` through Horner composition. When `u` is a single-term series (exactly one non-zero coefficient in `SeriesObj` terms) we skip the `O(N^2)` convolution and emit `binomial(alpha, k) * (b/a)^k` directly at exponent `k*m`. This covers `Sqrt[1+x]`, `(1 - x^2)^(1/2)`, `(1+x)^(-1/2)`, `(2 + 3x)^(1/3)`, `(1+x)^n` with symbolic `n`, and Puiseux bases like `(1+x^(1/2))^(1/2)`.
- **split-two-term probe** (`series_split_two_term` in `series.h`). Structural decomposition of `e` into `a + b*x^(p/q)` without running the full series-expansion pipeline. Feeds the Log fast path and the Apart gate; exposed for unit testing.
- **Log fast path**: when `arg` matches `a + b x^(p/q)` with `a, b` both free of `x` and `a != 1`, rewrite `Log[a + b x^c]` as `Log[a] + Log[1 + (b/a) x^c]` and let the `Log1p` kernel compose with a pure monomial. Maxima's `sp2log` uses the same identity.
- **Apart preprocessing**: if the input contains `Power[p(x), -n]` for `p` a polynomial in `x`, run `Apart[f, x]` to decompose into partial fractions before expanding. Composite denominators like `1/((1-x)(1-2x)(1-3x))` then break up into geometric-series pieces that hit the monomial fast path. Gated by a polynomial check so non-rational denominators (e.g. `1/(Exp[x] - 1 - x)`) bypass Apart and fall through to the generic `so_inv` path.

**Branch-point expansion for inverse trig / hyperbolic heads** (MMA-faithful). All eight `Arc*` heads expand at their branch points with the same wrapped output shape:

```
Plus[ f(x0),
      Times[ log_coef, Log[x - x0] ],         (Family B only)
      Times[ (-1)^Floor[(Pi/2 - Arg[x - x0])/(2 Pi)],
             SeriesData[...] ] ]
```

The `(-1)^Floor[...]` factor is the MMA branch discriminator — it is `1` on the principal sheet near `x0` and flips sign across the branch cut. Two mathematical families:

- **Family A — square-root branches** (derivative ~ `1/Sqrt[(x - x0) * linear]`): `ArcSin` / `ArcCos` at `x = ±1`; `ArcSinh` at `x = ±I`; `ArcCosh` at `x = ±1`. Output is a Puiseux series with `den = 2` and no `Log` term. Derived from the identities `ArcCos[1 - s] = Sqrt[2s] · Σ b_k s^k / (2k+1)`, `b_k = (2k)! / (8^k (k!)^2)`, `ArcSinh[σI + u] = σ·I·π/2 + 2 ArcSinh[Sqrt[u / (2σI)]]`, and the principal-branch `ArcCosh[1 + u] = 2 ArcSinh[Sqrt[u/2]]`.
- **Family B — logarithmic branches** (derivative has a simple pole at `x0`): `ArcTan` / `ArcCot` at `x = ±I`; `ArcTanh` / `ArcCoth` at `x = ±1`. Output contains an explicit `Log[x - x0]` term with its own coefficient (e.g. `-1/2` for `ArcTanh@1`, `-I/2` for `ArcTan@I`) plus a regular power series with `den = 1`. Derived from the identities `ArcTanh[x] = (1/2) Log[(1 + x)/(1 - x)]` and `ArcTan[z] = (1/(2 I)) Log[(1 + I z)/(1 - I z)]`.

The handler fires when the inner series at `x0` is exactly `c + q (x - x0)` (constant plus linear, with `q ≠ 0`) and `c` matches the branch-point value. For nested cases (e.g. `Sin[ArcSinh[x]]` near `x = I`), composition is preserved by emitting a constant-inside `SeriesObj` instead of the wrapper.

Examples:

```mathematica
In[]:= Series[ArcSinh[x], {x, I, 3}]
Out[]= I Pi/2 + (-1)^Floor[(Pi/2 - Arg[x - I])/(2 Pi)] (
         (1 - I) Sqrt[x - I] + (1 + I)/12 (x - I)^(3/2)
         + (-3 + 3 I)/160 (x - I)^(5/2) + O[x - I]^(7/2) )

In[]:= Series[ArcTanh[x], {x, 1, 3}]
Out[]= Log[2]/2 + I Pi/2 - Log[x - 1]/2 + (-1)^Floor[(Pi/2 - Arg[x-1])/(2 Pi)] (
         (x - 1)/4 - (x - 1)^2/16 + (x - 1)^3/48 + O[x - 1]^4 )

In[]:= Series[ArcCosh[x + 1], {x, 0, 5}]
Out[]= (-1)^Floor[(Pi/2 - Arg[x])/(2 Pi)] (
         Sqrt[2] Sqrt[x] - Sqrt[2]/12 x^(3/2) + 3 Sqrt[2]/160 x^(5/2)
         - 5 Sqrt[2]/896 x^(7/2) + 35 Sqrt[2]/18432 x^(9/2) + O[x]^(11/2) )
```

`Normal[Series[ArcTanh[x], {x, 1, 3}]]` preserves the `Log[x - 1]` term and the branch discriminator — `Normal` collapses the inner `SeriesData` but the surrounding `Plus`/`Times` pass through unchanged (matching MMA).

**Naive-Taylor fallback**: For expansion points that are not branch points (e.g. `Series[ArcSinh[x], {x, 1 + I, 3}]`, `Series[ArcSin[x], {x, 1/2, 3}]`), `series_expand` falls back to naive Taylor via repeated `D`. The fallback caps iterations and bails out on `Infinity` / `Indeterminate` derivatives so unknown heads cannot spin the engine. The singularity probe **evaluates** the substituted `f^(k)(x0)` with arithmetic warnings muted before testing for infinities, so an *unevaluated* pole produced by the substitution (e.g. `f[1/x]` at `x = 0` becoming `f[1/0]`) collapses to `ComplexInfinity` / `Indeterminate` and is detected cleanly — it no longer spills a spurious `Power::infy: 1/0` to stderr before the guard fires. So heads with no recognised expansion at the requested point (e.g. `Series[Gamma[x], {x, Infinity, 2}]`) return unevaluated silently rather than with a stray warning.

## Normal
Converts a `SeriesData` back into an ordinary expression by dropping its O-term.
- `Normal[expr]`

**Features**:
- `Protected`.
- Returns the Plus of the coefficient-times-power terms (zero coefficients skipped). For non-`SeriesData` input, `Normal` is the identity.
- Recurses through the whole expression, dropping the O-term of **every** `SeriesData` at any depth. This matters for expansions around `+-Infinity`, whose `SeriesData` is wrapped inside `Plus`/`Times` (e.g. the trig- or exponential-prefactored asymptotic forms of `BesselJ`, `BesselK`, `AiryAi`, `AiryBiPrime`); the surrounding factors are preserved and recombined by the evaluator.

```mathematica
In[1]:= Normal[Series[Exp[x], {x, 0, 5}]]
Out[1]= 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + x^5/120

In[2]:= Normal[a + b]
Out[2]= a + b

In[3]:= Normal[Series[BesselJ[0, x], {x, Infinity, 2}]]
Out[3]= Sqrt[2/Pi] Sqrt[1/x] Cos[1/4 Pi - x] - 1/8 Sqrt[2/Pi] (1/x)^(3/2) Sin[1/4 Pi - x]
```

## SeriesCoefficient
Gives the coefficient of `(x - x0)^k` in the power-series expansion of `f`.
- `SeriesCoefficient[f, {x, x0, k}]`

**Features**:
- `HoldAll`, `Protected`.
- Computed by expanding with `Series` and extracting the `k`-th coefficient from
  the resulting `SeriesData`; general for any head `Series` can expand, with a
  concrete integer index `k` and a finite expansion point.
- Composite results (a prefactor times a `SeriesData`, e.g. asymptotic
  expansions at Infinity) and non-integer indices are left unevaluated; the
  symbolic-index general term (a Piecewise) is not produced.

```mathematica
In[1]:= SeriesCoefficient[BesselJ[0, x], {x, 0, 4}]
Out[1]= 1/64

In[2]:= SeriesCoefficient[Exp[x], {x, 0, 5}]
Out[2]= 1/120
```

### picocas's Factor changes behaviour inside Simplify

`builtin_factor` at `src/facpoly.c:2896` checks
`bool inside_simplify = (factor_memo_top() != NULL);` and uses a
**combined** num/den variable list (vs the **separate** lists used
outside). The combined-scope behaviour can refuse to factor a
denominator like `Factorial[n] + n*Factorial[n]` -> `Factorial[n]*(n+1)`
because the polynomial-in-`n` viewer treats `Factorial[n]` as a
non-factorable coefficient.

Workaround: `factor_memo_push(NULL)` around the Factor call to
force-disable the inside-Simplify branch for that one invocation,
then `factor_memo_pop()`. Direct user `Factor[a]` works because no
memo is active.

This is now documented in the `simp_factorial` source comments.

### picocas does NOT auto-coalesce `Power[a,-1] * Power[b,-1]`

Mathematica's evaluator combines `Times[Power[a, -1], Power[b, -1]]`
into `Power[Times[a, b], -1]`; picocas's evaluator does not. The
un-coalesced form scores higher under SimplifyCount than the
coalesced form (count 12 vs 9 on `1/(n*(n-1))`), so a factorial
rewrite that lands at a Times-of-inverses can lose the round-loop
tiebreak even though it is the canonical answer.

`simp_fact_combine_inverses` handles this manually: at every Times
node, partition children into "no `-1` power" vs "carries exponent
`-1`", coalesce the latter into a single `Power[Times[...], -1]`.
Conservative -- only exponent `-1` is collapsed, not arbitrary
negative exponents.

### `Together` expands polynomial denominators

picocas's `Together` returns `n/(Factorial[n] + n*Factorial[n])`, NOT
`n/(Factorial[n]*(n+1))`. The factored form has to be recovered via
a follow-up `Factor` (with the memo workaround above).

### simp_classify must route factorial inputs to the general pipeline

The rational / polynomial pipelines (`simp_pipeline_rational`,
`simp_pipeline_polynomial`) don't seed `FactorialRules`, so factorial
inputs that classified as `SHAPE_RATIONAL` would silently miss the
factorial rewrite. Added `if (contains_factorial(e)) return
SIMP_SHAPE_GENERAL;` to `simp_classify`.

### Force-take vs SimplifyCount

A factorial-free form often scores **higher** under SimplifyCount than
the factorial-bearing input (the input has fewer leaves). Without a
force-take, the round loop reverts to the input. The fix mirrors
LogExpRules / AssumptionRules: when the candidate strictly reduces the
factorial-atom count, force-take it as the new best regardless of
SimplifyCount tiebreak.

### Forward declarations across the simp.c monolith

`simp.c` is ~10K lines with a single-pass C99 compile, so a helper
defined after `simp_search` cannot be called from `simp_search` /
`transform_can_fire` without a forward decl. Putting the forward
decls right above `SIMP_TRANSFORMS[]` (the earliest place they're
needed) keeps the cluster discoverable.

# Discriminant

!!! success "Status: Stable"
    documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

## Description

```text
Discriminant[poly, var]
    gives the discriminant of poly with respect to var: up to sign and
    leading-coefficient scaling, Resultant[poly, D[poly, var], var] /
    lc[poly, var].  Vanishes iff poly has a repeated root in var.
```

## Examples

All examples below are verified against the current Mathilda build.

```mathematica
In[1]:= Discriminant[a x^2 + b x + c, x]
Out[1]= b^2 - 4 a c

In[2]:= Discriminant[5 x^4 - 3 x + 9, x]
Out[2]= 23273325

In[3]:= Discriminant[(x-1)(x-2)(x-3), x]
Out[3]= 4

In[4]:= Discriminant[(x-1)(x-2)(x-1), x]
Out[4]= 0
```

## Implementation notes

- `Protected`, `Listable`.
- Computes the discriminant of polynomial `poly` with respect to `var`.
- The discriminant is zero if and only if the polynomial has multiple roots.
- Derived symbolically utilizing the formula $D = \frac{(-1)^{n(n-1)/2}}{a_n} Resultant(P, P', var)$.

**Attributes:** `Listable`, `Protected`.

## Implementation status

**Stable** — documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

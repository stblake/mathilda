# Tr

!!! success "Status: Stable"
    documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

## Description

```text
Tr[m]
    gives the trace of the matrix m, i.e. the sum of its diagonal
    entries (for a rectangular m, sums entries m[[i, i]] up to
    Min[Dimensions[m]]).
Tr[m, f]
    combines the diagonal entries with f instead of Plus.
Tr[m, f, n]
    walks down to level n, summing the multi-index diagonal of a
    rank-n tensor.
```

## Examples

All examples below are verified against the current Mathilda build.

```mathematica
In[1]:= Tr[{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}]
Out[1]= 15

In[2]:= Tr[{{a, b}, {c, d}}]
Out[2]= a + d

In[3]:= Tr[{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}, List]
Out[3]= {1, 5, 9}

In[4]:= Tr[{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}, Plus, 1]
Out[4]= {12, 15, 18}
```

## Implementation notes

- `Protected`.
- `Tr[list]` sums the diagonal elements `list[[i, i, ...]]`.
- `Tr[list, f]` applies the function `f` instead of `Plus`.
- `Tr[list, f, n]` considers elements down to level `n`.
- Works for rectangular as well as square matrices and tensors, stopping at the minimum dimension.
- If `n` is omitted, defaults to the depth of the tensor.

**Attributes:** `Protected`.

## Implementation status

**Stable** — documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

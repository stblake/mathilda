# Replace

!!! success "Status: Stable"
    documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

## Description

```text
Replace[expr, rules]
    tries to match expr at the top level against rules and returns the
    rewritten form; if no rule matches, returns expr unchanged.
Replace[expr, rules, levelspec]
    applies rules only at the parts of expr specified by levelspec.
Matching tries each rule in order and uses the first that succeeds;
rules may be a single rule or a list of rules.
```

## Examples

All examples below are verified against the current Mathilda build.

```mathematica
In[1]:= Replace[x^2, x^2 -> a + b]
Out[1]= a + b

In[2]:= Replace[1 + x^2, x^2 -> a + b]
Out[2]= 1 + x^2

In[3]:= Replace[x, {{x -> a}, {x -> b}}]
Out[3]= {a, b}

In[4]:= Replace[1 + x^2, x^2 -> a + b, {1}]
Out[4]= 1 + a + b
```

## Implementation notes

- `Protected`.
- Rules must be of the form `lhs -> rhs` (`Rule`) or `lhs :> rhs` (`RuleDelayed`).
- Tries rules in order. The first one that matches is applied.
- If rules are given in nested lists, `Replace` is mapped onto the inner lists.
- Standard level specifications (`n`, `Infinity`, `All`, `{n}`, `{n1, n2}`) are fully supported with the default being `{0}` (the whole expression).
- Expressions at deeper levels in a subexpression are matched first.
- Replaces parts even inside `Hold` or related wrappers.

**Attributes:** `Protected`.

## Implementation status

**Stable** — documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

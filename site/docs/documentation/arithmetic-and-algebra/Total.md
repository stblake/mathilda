# Total

!!! success "Status: Stable"
    documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

## Description

```text
Total[list]
    gives the total of the elements in list.
Total[list, n]
    totals all elements down to level n.
Total[list, {n}]
    totals elements at level n.
Total[list, {n1, n2}]
    totals elements at levels n1 through n2.
```

## Examples

All examples below are verified against the current Mathilda build.

```mathematica
In[1]:= Total[{a, b, c, d}]
Out[1]= a + b + c + d

In[2]:= Total[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}]
Out[2]= {4, 6}

In[3]:= Total[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}, 2]
Out[3]= 10

In[4]:= Total[{{1, 2}, {3}}, 2]
Out[4]= 6
```

## Implementation notes

- `Protected`.
- `Total[list]` is equivalent to `Apply[Plus, list]`.
- `Total[list, n]` totals all elements down to level `n`.
- `Total[list, {n}]` totals elements at level `n` only.
- Supports negative levels to count from the bottom (`-1` is the last dimension).
- Handles ragged arrays correctly by summing from the inside out when multiple levels are specified.
- `Total[list, Infinity]` totals all atoms in the expression.

**Attributes:** `Protected`.

## Implementation status

**Stable** — documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

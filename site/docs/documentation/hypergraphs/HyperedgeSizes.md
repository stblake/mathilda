# HyperedgeSizes

!!! success "Status: Stable"
    documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

## Description

**`HyperedgeSizes[h] gives the arity (Length) of each hyperedge of h, in EdgeList order.`**

## Examples (6)

Every input below was run against the current Mathilda build and its output recorded.

### Basic examples (6)

```mathematica
In[1]:= HyperedgeSizes[Hypergraph[{{1,2,3},{3,4},{4,5,6},{7}}]]
Out[1]= {3, 2, 3, 1}

In[2]:= {HypergraphRank[Hypergraph[{{1,2,3},{3,4},{4,5,6},{7}}]], HypergraphCorank[Hypergraph[{{1,2,3},{3,4},{4,5,6},{7}}]]}
Out[2]= {3, 1}

In[3]:= UniformHypergraphQ[Hypergraph[{{1,2,3},{2,3,4}}], 3]
Out[3]= True

In[4]:= HyperedgeSizes[Hypergraph[{{1,1,2},{}}]]
Out[4]= {3, 0}

In[5]:= {HypergraphRank[Hypergraph[{1,2},{}]], HypergraphCorank[Hypergraph[{1,2},{}]], UniformHypergraphQ[Hypergraph[{1,2},{}]]}
Out[5]= {0, 0, True}

In[6]:= HyperedgeSizes[{{1, 2}}]
Out[6]= HyperedgeSizes[{{1, 2}}]
```

## Implementation notes

- Arity is the hyperedge's `Length` as written, counting a repeated vertex and
  giving 0 for an empty hyperedge.
- With no hyperedges, `HypergraphRank` and `HypergraphCorank` are 0 and
  `UniformHypergraphQ` is `True`.
- `UniformHypergraphQ` gives `False` for a non-hypergraph; the other three are
  left unevaluated on one.
- Benchmark (experiment 96): `HyperedgeSizes` on 10⁵ hyperedges 0.024 ms warm /
  0.025 ms cold (Mathematica 5.6 ms, xgi 9.6 ms).

**Attributes:** `Protected`.

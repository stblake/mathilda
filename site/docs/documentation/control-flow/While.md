# While

!!! success "Status: Stable"
    documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

## Description

```text
While[test, body] evaluates test, then body, repeatedly, until test first fails to give True.
While[test] does the loop with a Null body, which is useful when test has side-effects.
While has attribute HoldAll.
Break[] inside body exits the loop.
Continue[] inside body skips the rest of body and re-evaluates test.
Return[v] inside body causes While to yield v; otherwise While returns Null.
```

## Examples

All examples below are verified against the current Mathilda build.

```mathematica
In[1]:= n = 1; While[n < 4, n = n + 1]; n
Out[1]= 4

In[2]:= {a, b} = {27, 6}; While[b != 0, {t1, t2} = {b, Mod[a, b]}; a = t1; b = t2]; a
Out[2]= 3

In[3]:= n = 1; While[True, If[n > 10, Break[]]; n = n + 1]; n
Out[3]= 11
```

## Implementation notes

- Has attribute `HoldAll`; both `test` and `body` are re-evaluated each iteration.
- `Break[]` inside `body` exits the loop, yielding `Null`.
- `Continue[]` inside `body` skips the rest of `body` and returns to re-evaluating `test`.
- `Return[v]` inside `body` causes `While` to yield `v`.
- `Throw`, `Abort`, and `Quit` propagate unchanged.
- If the very first evaluation of `test` is not `True`, `body` is never evaluated.
- Returns `Null` unless an explicit `Return` is issued.

**Attributes:** `HoldAll`, `Protected`.

## Implementation status

**Stable** — documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

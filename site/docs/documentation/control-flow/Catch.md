# Catch

!!! success "Status: Stable"
    documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.

## Description

```text
Catch[expr]
    Returns the argument of the first Throw generated while
    evaluating expr, or expr if none. Catch[expr, form] catches only a
    Throw[value, tag] whose tag matches form (tag is re-evaluated per
    comparison); Catch[expr, form, f] returns f[value, tag].
```

## Examples

All examples below are verified against the current Mathilda build.

```mathematica
In[1]:= Catch[a; b; Throw[c]; d; e]
Out[1]= c

In[2]:= f[x_] := If[x > 10, Throw[overflow], x!]; Catch[f[2] + f[11]]
Out[2]= overflow

In[3]:= Catch[Do[If[i! > 10^10, Throw[i]], {i, 100}]]
Out[3]= 14

In[4]:= Catch[Throw[a, u], u]
Out[4]= a

In[5]:= Catch[Throw[v, tg], tg, {#1, #2} &]
Out[5]= {v, tg}
```

## Implementation notes

- `Throw` is `Protected`; `Catch` is `HoldFirst, Protected` (it drives evaluation of its body itself, so it can intercept a throw; `form` and `f` evaluate normally).
- Implemented by sentinel propagation through the evaluator's normal return paths (no `setjmp`/`longjmp`), so every frame runs its own cleanup — leak-free.
- The first `Throw` evaluated wins; a tagless `Throw[value]` is not caught by a form-`Catch`.
- An uncaught `Throw[value]`/`Throw[value, tag]` returns `Hold[Throw[...]]` with a `Throw::nocatch` message; an uncaught `Throw[value, tag, f]` returns `f[value, tag]`.

**Attributes:** `HoldFirst`, `Protected`.

## Implementation status

**Stable** — documented, exercised by the test suite and/or worked examples, with no known limitations recorded.
